In the face of academic demands ratcheting higher, stressing out children, parents, and teachers, seven years ago, I set out to write Grade-By-Grade: A Guide to Raising Smart, Happy Kids, K–5. The book would be a What to Expect When You’re Expecting for elementary school. I wanted to help bring families closer in this techno-hustle world and support parents in raising well-adjusted children.

I’d collected a boatload of convenient games for parents and children to play on car rides, at the doctor’s office, or in line at the grocery store at each grade level—activities to strengthen relationships and help kids thrive, whatever their environment.

After twenty-three years of teaching in the classroom, three years of reading studies and articles, and doing interviews with lots of professionals and parents, I decided I was ready to take an online class with Media Bistro to write a killer book proposal. But once I started sending out queries and talking to agents and publishers at conferences, the response was always the same:

“It’s a great idea, but parenting books written by teachers don’t sell well.”

My plastic file box, jammed with folders of notes, articles, research studies, and interviews, collected dust in our garage for three more years.

When our older daughter graduated from Cal Poly, and our younger daughter was in her senior year at Williams College, my husband and I decided to move to Bend, Oregon, to put 94.9 Central Oregon Fox Sports Radio on the air. To make the move from San Diego, California, we threw out eighteen years of accumulated non-essentials—including my box full of research.

But no effort is wasted.

I often remind the authors I coach this. Our endeavors don’t always get rewarded in the time-frame we expect. Sometimes the skills we learn on a project apply to the next one that gets the results we’ve been seeking.




​Shortly after my husband and I moved to Bend, I arranged for Howard Shulman to give a presentation on his book Running From the Mirror and to teach a workshop with me on how to write a memoir at the San Diego Southern California Writers’ Conference in February 2016. His publisher, Sandra, of Sandra Jonas Publishing in Boulder, Colorado, called me to coordinate promotions for the book.

And the two of us hit it off. Sandra is an incredibly conscientious, passionate hard-worker—like I am.

After the conference, we kept in contact, and she asked me to do a developmental edit for one of her authors. This author’s novel had a fabulous premise, but the story and characters needed fleshing out—which we did, and it’s awesome now!





Watermelon Snow by debut author William Liggett, an intriguing story of scientists, melting glaciers, catastrophic egos, treacherous journeys across the ice, and a bit of romantic tension, chock-full of suspense that’s sure to keep you turning pages, was released in June 2017.

When wrapping up the edit for Watermelon Snow, Sandra mentioned one of her other authors, Jacqueline Frischknecht. Jackie was a PhD who’d done extensive research related to how brain function and development affect children’s learning.

“What a fabulous idea!” I said and gave Sandra my one-sentence summary of the Grade-by-Grade project so she would know I had the background to provide whatever help she needed. She talked about hiring me to edit Jackie's manuscript.

Sadly, Jackie passed away, and her dying wish had been to publish the book. Her family wanted to see that wish granted. Sandra asked me to read the manuscript to see if I could do a content edit that would (a) make Jackie’s writing sound more conversational, (b) hone the focus, and (c) flesh out the work to make the book user-friendly for parents and teachers.

Excited to work with Sandra on another project, I told her I would be happy to read the manuscript and come up with a plan to get it in shape for publication.


Jackie Frischknecht


Jackie’s research was excellent and her ideas empowering.

However, to make the book an effective resource, the material needed to be geared for parents or educators, not both. Experts all over the country train teachers to use brain research to drive curriculum, such as Dr. Eric Jenkins, Dr. Carol Dwek, and veteran teacher Pat Wolfe, so I told Sandra that Jackie’s work might best serve parents.

Still, to create such a manuscript, I would have to read more recent studies, as brain development has been a hot topic over the last decade in the research community. I’d have to almost rewrite Jackie’s book to make it work.





“Would you mind sending me your Grade-by-Grade book proposal?” Sandra asked.

Although I’d tossed my magic box of research, the proposal had been saved on a flash drive, so I said, “Sure,” and attached the file to an email without much thought.

A week later, Sandra called and said she loved my book proposal: my voice, the grade-by-grade progression, how I present what will be expected of kids that year socially and academically, the games, the “Real Deal” (goofy true-life stories), the tips for everything from communicating with teachers to family organization to healthy snacks on the go . . .

And Sandra had sent the proposal to Jackie’s family. She asked them how they would feel about me co-writing the book—that is, I would apply Jackie’s research on brain function and development to my grade-by-grade structure, integrating  social development, academic expectations, games, tips for organization, and all the rest.

Jackie’s family liked the idea, and I  went to work on the manuscript. I mourned the loss of the box I’d thrown out in the move, but truthfully, the more recent interviews and research will better serve parents anyway.

Though I never had the pleasure to meet Jackie in person, we share our passion for educating and empowering children and families. At times, I felt her looking over my shoulder, guiding my research, nudging me to include this or that as my fingers flew across the keyboard. I learned so much about brain development, how humans learn, and WHY the games and activities I'd done with kids all those years were so effective.

BRAIN STAGES: How to Raise Smart, Confident Kids and Have Fun Doing It, K–5, by Patricia Wilkinson and Jacqueline Frischknecht, PhD, will be released November 13, 2018.

THIS is the book that was meant to be published.

      <title>A Salty Kick Start for Reading and Writing</title>

Whether your child loves to read and write, is struggling mightily, or somewhere in between, SALT can be an inexpensive “toy” with a big payoff. Studies show motor learning in conjunction with sensory input does an extra good job of connecting neural pathways—for kids as well as adults (Ostry DJ et al. 2010). After all, using your fingers to write letters in salt feels funny, while providing motivation for learning and reinforcement in the memory centers in the brain.

Watch how much faster those words get “in-grained” for further use from writing in a thin layer of salt on a cookie sheet. In fact, you might want to take turns with your child and try writing a few things you'd like to remember too.

Rewards are a fantastic tool to boost learning (Schultz 2015), so in recognition for your child’s awesome salt writing, turn the salt into play dough together. The Big Bonus: rolling and manipulating dough builds the muscles in kids’ hands which improves dexterity for writing, throwing and catching, pushing the right buttons on the electronic tablet or computer . . .

You get the idea.

If you don’t have a favorite dough recipe, Imagination Tree has a quick, easy no-cook option. You can check it out here. If you have comments or other fun suggestions, we sure hope you’ll share them with us!

The Big Bonus: rolling and manipulating dough builds the muscles in kids’ hands which improves <a href="/blog/the-best-pencil-grip-the-secret-to-easier-writing">dexterity for writing</a>, throwing and catching, pushing the right buttons on the electronic tablet or computer . . .<br>
<br>
You get the idea.<br>

      <title>4 Ways to Make Gift Giving Great in Your Family</title>

I recently read a hilarious post a mom wrote about how her expectations of Christmas morning turned out wildly different than the reality. Her fantasy of sharing warm moments of love, appreciation, and togetherness with her family shattered into a self-absorbed, paper-flying frenzy that ended in palpable disappointment with a highly anticipated moment ending too soon.

I laughed as I read because I could relate to her experience, growing up with three siblings and myself all ripping into our gifts at once on Christmas morning.

After Mom’s um-teen hours of buying, wrapping, and taping, we turned her selfless labor into about three minutes of chaos, punctuated by the disenchantment that follows any such gluttony. Was that all there was? Were we sure the few unopened presents still under the tree were for people other than us?

Frankly, I grew up to be somewhat of a Grinch when it came to family-wide gift giving. Luckily, when my husband and I had children, his experience had been different, and we came up with a much more pleasant, satisfying family tradition.

I’m not saying our kids didn’t start out wanting to dive into a ripping fury. The first couple of years took some gentle tapping of brakes along with hugs and explanations, but it didn’t take long for them to accept that this is the way we open gifts together.

Here are four ways to make gift-giving holidays the wonderful events we want them to be:

1. Get your child(ren) invested in the holiday and what giving means by making gifts for other members of the family.

And that includes grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. For example, from the time our kids could help pour sugar and flour into the bowl, we used all kinds of cookie cutters to make small packages of yummy treats for everyone. Giving each person a couple of cookies is plenty to get the point across that reciprocal gifts are fun.

When our kids were too little to wrap, we put frosted cookies into clear cello bags we got from the craft store and tied them with ribbon.  

A word of caution: When our kids got older, I set them loose to make the cookies themselves. One year, that didn’t work out so well because one of them accidentally used salt instead of sugar in a madcap set of misunderstandings. Needless to say, the cookies looked nice, but they tasted disgusting. You may want to hang out and talk to your kids while they assemble the dough, no matter how old they are—especially if they get distracted as easily as we do in our family.

But if you hate to bake, don’t let that discourage you from teaching your kids about gift giving.

One year our kids drew pictures for everyone and glued them onto construction paper to "frame" them. I helped them write captions to go with the pictures, which ended up cute and funny because, well, kids are cute and funny. We've made everyone ornaments with pine cones, Popsicle sticks, glitter, and lots of other simple, inexpensive materials. 

Most of those gifts have likely gotten tossed by family members over the years, but kids who participate in gift-giving look differently at receiving because they appreciate the effort that went into the present as well as the thing they find under the wrapping. When your kids get old enough to do odd jobs, let them earn money to buy small presents for people. Kids love shopping for gifts for others to open.

2. On Christmas morning, or any other gift-giving event your family celebrates, have your kids take turns picking out a gift for someone else to open.

You’d be surprised how quick they are to hand presents to their sibling(s). Children figure out fast that sharing with a brother or sister means a present will likely land in their laps to open. 

3. Have family members open gifts one at a time.

This way, everyone has a chance to see what others have given and received. Both the giver and the getter can be the center of attention for a moment as the family ooohs and aaahs over whatever came out of the gift bag. The recipient also has an opportunity to thank the giver before moving on to the next present.

4. Once the gifts have been opened, ask each person to choose a quick task to help clean up, so Mom or Dad doesn’t end up taking care of the entire mess after breakfast.

You’ve heard the saying, “Many hands make light work, right?”

Make a game of counting to ten to see if, as a team, you can get all the torn paper thrown into the trash, the gift bags folded and stacked, and the bows collected to be used again throughout the year. Another job might be to fold garment boxes for later use as well.

Admittedly, getting everyone to participate in cleanup was a little more difficult in our household because we didn’t think to start this practice until the kids were a bit older.

The best time to create such habits is when kids are in second grade or younger, at an age when they like the feeling of competency that comes from contributing to a family project. 
 
What is gift giving like in your house? Wild and crazy, tame and civilized, or somewhere in between?

What tradition(s) have evolved in your household that have made gift-giving more enjoyable for your family? 



HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

      <title>The Best Pencil Grip: The Secret to Easier Writing</title>

 Would your child prefer to do other things besides writing? Does he take breaks during homework to shake out his hands? Does he lose interest or get tired of assignments quickly?

Check out how your child is holding the pencil.

Lots of kids these days use their thumbs to support the pencil between two fingers on top and two underneath—which limits mobility, causing cramping and fatigue. You might even hold a pen or pencil that way yourself and find writing sort of a pain—literally.

You’ll see in the four-minute video how to recreate your child’s pencil grip for happier writing, and possibly your own. (Note: The first part with 8-year-old Morgan is a bit bumpy because we didn’t have the camera stand for her big brother, 11-year-old Riley, to shoot the clip.)

Here’s the thing: In kindergarten and first grade, kids used to learn the “traditional grip” of holding the pencil between the thumb and pointer finger with the remaining three fingers underneath.

I’m not normally a “good ol’ days” kind of a gal. In fact, I maintain that between research and technology, our kids have more incredible learning opportunities than ever before. But the increased mobility of the pointer finger and thumb to manipulate the pen or pencil, supported by three fingers rather than two, allows for faster writing and longer stamina.

These days, preschoolers are introduced to writing—they practice their names and simple words. By the end of kindergarten, five- and six-year-old children are expected to write simple three- to five-sentence paragraphs. But most little kids’ muscles in their hands aren’t strong enough yet to write with only one finger on top of the pencil. They often use two fingers to support the pencil against the thumb, or they wrap the thumb over the pencil to get a tighter hold.

By the time they get older and strong enough to hold the pencil in a more practical, comfortable way, they’re in the habit of slower, less flexible writing that makes their hands ache. And we all know that habits can be hard to break.

Cello tape to the rescue!

Put a piece of tape around the tallest and ring fingers. Then position the pencil between the thumb and pointer finger, with all three fingers underneath (see video). The tape will provide a little extra support and be a subtle reminder of creating a new, empowering habit. Besides, the tape adds a fun twist to writing.

The novelty is short-lived, though, so you’ll have to be supportive and consistent in taping fingers. If your child is capable, show her how to tape her own fingers. Then check to make sure the middle fingers get taped together daily, before she dives into homework.

Every time your child gets to the end of a homework assignment without feeling like her hand will fall off, you’ll get more buy-in for the new grip. Remember, creating a new habit requires consistency and patience, so be prepared to spend a few weeks on the new pencil grip.

For faster results, check with your child’s teacher.

Ask your child’s teacher if you can send a roll of tape to school for your child to tape her middle fingers in class until she no longer needs the support or the reminder to use the new pencil grip.

Your example goes a long way.

If you hold a pen or pencil with two fingers on top, practice the new pencil grip along with your child and support each other in forming the new habit.

How do your kids hold their pencils?

If you, your partner, or child holds the pencil in a creative way, we’d love for you to send a picture to trish@thebrainstages.com for us to share.

And check out this fun way to help young kids master their letters and older kids learn new spelling and vocabulary words.

Happy writing!

        <wp:comment_content>Nice strategy. I wish I'd thought of it when I was teaching sixth grade, but this is definitely a habit that needs to be established in Kg or earlier. Keep up the good work on this blog.</wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content>Ha! Kids of all ages change their pencil grip—even adults. They just have to see how great it will be once they get used to the new grip and make the decision to learn the new habit.

This is also a great life-lesson—that we aren't stuck with something for the rest of our lives because we learned it when we were little. And kids love the tape!</wp:comment_content>

Would you like to have a few good laughs with your kids or friends while building observation and description skills that strengthen the language centers in the brain (Romeo et al. 2018)?

Play Guess Who? — a game you can play anytime, anywhere.

Take turns offering clues about characters in books or movies, political figures, professional athletes, family members, pets, wild animals, friends, kids in the Scout troop, at dance practice, or on sports teams. 

Give facts, habits, mannerisms, or aspects of appearance one at a time, until the other player(s) can guess the right person, character, or animal. This game gives people an incentive to notice physical features, personality, and movement as well as to remember things they learn.
 
Even better, their brains are great at applying this practiced attention to detail to performing science experiments, writing essays and short stories, and doing any number of other activities — in school, in work, in life.











In the video, 11-year-old Riley and his mom, Sarah Latta, give a hilarious example of the game in their family room. Sisters Chloe and Mehgan also make a fun effort in my family room.

Although the game is shown with only two players, the more the merrier. In fact, this is a great game to play in teams — especially if you find yourself at a party or special event with a bunch of kids — or adults — and have some time to kill.

Here’s all you do:


State the category (character in book or movie, someone you know, an animal, or a celebrity).

Give a clue and pause for the other player(s) to guess.

If players can’t come up with the right person or animal, provide another detail.

Continue to offer attributes of the person or animal, one at a time, until players get it right.

You can play without keeping score, or tally the number of guesses each player or team makes before landing on the right person or animal. At the end of the game, when both players or teams have had an equal number of turns, the fewest number of guesses determines the winner.
 
You may be surprised how silly Guess Who? can get. And everyone needs a little laughter. Enjoy!

Let us know how you like this game and if you have other suggestions for fun on the fly.

If you’ve played Guess Who? before, tell us about it, and let us know if you've come up with variations.

Eli plays the Names for 10 game to boost math skills.





Whether your child is a math wiz or struggling to understand and apply new concepts, learning all the number combinations that add up to 10 can be THE thing to set your child on a trajectory for major success in math.

Why? Because we live in a society of base 10. Weights and measures, money, fractions, decimals, percentages, just about everything can be related to our base 10 system.

The super math hack for kids is to learn all the “names for 10” by heart.
     10 + 0,   9 + 1,  8 + 2,  7 + 3,  6 + 4,  5 + 5,  4 + 6,  3 + 7,  2 + 8,  1 + 9,  0 + 10

Once they know these combinations automatically, they begin to see the pattern everywhere.

“Automatically” means they can glance at any number of objects and immediately know its partner.

Kids start to add and subtract in their heads. Multiplication and division come easily. Fractions and decimals make instant sense. Finding missing numbers (algebra) is fun. Graphing becomes obvious. Estimating for quick calculations is a snap.

They start being able to use math in their lives.

For instance, they figure out how many more of something they need to reach a goal,  if they can afford to buy an item they want, how to fairly split a bag of M&amp;Ms with friends, or how to help their parents decide on a tip to give the server at a restaurant.

This small thing—knowing the number partners that make 10—will give your child a huge leg up in math and, quite possibly, in life.

This math hack builds confidence, especially when kids "wow" people with how they figure out things, without having to write them down or grab a calculator.

Take a few minutes to watch Eli, a second-grader, show you how to play the Names for 10 game, and let your son or daughter try it out:











Here’s how to ingrain the names for 10 in your child’s brain and give him a leg up for life:



Set out a pile of something fun to be counted: nuts, cereal, raisins, buttons, pennies, M&amp;Ms—and have your child count out 10 items.

Separate one item to the right of the group and count the objects in each location. Have your child say out loud: “9 + 1 = 10.”

Continue the previous step with one more item moving to the pile on the right until your child reaches: “0 + 10 = 10.”

Now repeat the process starting with: “10 + 0 = 10,” and continue having your child slide one object to the left this time, vocalizing the name for 10: 9 + 1 = 10, 8 + 2 = 10, 7 + 3 = 10 . . . 0 + 10 = 10. This will tactilely and visually illustrate the commutative property of equality (a + b = b + a).



Note: If your child seems finished with the game and wants to eat the Cheerios, then you’re done for the day. Make sure the next time you play to repeat the first four steps before continuing with the next activity. On the other hand, if your child wants to keep going, have fun!



Grab a clear cup so your child can see the objects inside. Have him repeat steps two through four, placing the cup upside down over the pile the items move to. Challenge your child to say the names for 10 aloud and see if he can say the “number partners” without looking inside the cup. But let him peek if he needs to. Eventually, he’ll know them—when those neural pathways in his brain are solidly connected and the values are firmly implanted in the hypothalamus.


When you think your child is ready for a little more challenge, choose a random number of items to cover with the cup and see if he can “guess” the number of objects by counting the items outside of the cup.


Note: In the event of a wrong guess, have him count the objects in the pile, then through the clear cup, and say the entire name for 10: “6 + 4 = 10.”

The Names for 10 game can end here and pick up on another day unless your child is on a roll and wants to keep playing. Then replace the clear cup with a translucent one, and then an opaque one (see video). Challenge your child to tell you how many objects are hidden under the cup given the number of items in the exposed pile, and pick up the cup for him to confirm or amend his answers.

But be conscious about when your child is getting tired and stop there. You can always pick up the game and do next steps at another time. The most important thing is to have a good time!

Let us know how the Names for 10 game goes in your house.

Do you have a good idea for a convenient time and place for kids and parents to play this game? What items did you use to count? Did your son or daughter pick up the number partners that make 10 right away, or do you think you’ll need to play the game some more to get those combinations fully fixed in your child’s brain?

Please share with us. Other parents and kids will benefit from your ideas and experience!

Sofia plays the Names for 10 game with her fingers.





In the previous Names for 10 post, 7-year-old Eli showed you the secret for making math easier for kids (and adults) using a small (delicious) pile of M&amp;Ms.



 10 + 0,  9 + 1,  8 + 2,  7 + 3,  6 + 4,  5 + 5,
   4 + 6,  3 + 7,  2 + 8,  1 + 9,  0 + 10



Knowing those number partners, backwards and forwards — the commutative property (a + b = b + a) — makes so many other math concepts snap into place.

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, trading and regrouping (we used to call it carrying and borrowing), fractions, decimals, percentages, time, and money — all become easier.

In the video below, Sofia shows you how to practice these critical number partners using her fingers.

Most of us have 10 of those, right? No additional materials necessary.

And playing Names for 10 is a great way to pass the time while you wait in line or ride in a car — with a big payoff!











Some kids (and their parents) do better remembering the names for 10 when they can see the numbers along with the groups of items.

In the next video, Jude, a second-grader, demonstrates how to play the game with number cards and pennies.

Each time he moves an item from one pile to the other, he changes the cards to match the number of objects in each of the groupings that add up to 10.











Notice that Jude wrote the numbers from 0 to 10 on colored paper, making sure the number partners were the same color.

White paper is fine if that is what's available, but when number partners match in color, that gives kids one more way to cement the names for 10 in their brains.

I’ve found that the more senses people use to learn things, the better they remember.

Moving objects as well as number cards, especially color-coordinated ones, makes the groupings more visual. The physical shifting of objects also adds to kids’ familiarity with the number combinations that make 10.

Whether your child is in first grade or fifth, or if YOU could use a math hack to make you better at quick calculations — at the grocery store, at work, or anywhere you’d like a fast answer — instantly knowing the names for 10 will make all the difference!

If you have a math hack to share, please tell us about it in the comment section below.

We’d love to hear from you.

And please share Names for 10 with your friends!

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">
<strong>Notice that Jude wrote the numbers from 0 to 10 on colored paper, making sure the number partners were the same color.</strong><br>
<br>
White paper is fine if that is what's available, but when number partners match in color, that gives kids one more way to cement the names for 10 in their brains.<br>
<br>
<strong>I’ve found that the more senses people use to learn things, the better they remember.</strong><br>
<br>
Moving objects as well as number cards, especially color-coordinated ones, makes the groupings more visual. The physical shifting of objects also adds to kids’ familiarity with the number combinations that make 10.<br>
<br>
Whether your child is in first grade or fifth, or if YOU could use a math hack to make you better at quick calculations — at the grocery store, at work, or anywhere you’d like a fast answer — instantly knowing the names for 10 will make all the difference!<br>
<br>
<strong>If you have a math hack to share, please tell us about it in the comment section below.</strong><br>

We’d love to hear from you.</strong><br>

      <title>Summer Reading to Keep Kids Sharp: Grade 2</title>

Summer vacation gives kids lots of opportunities for free play, which is great for mental processing and creativity. The break between grade levels is a perfect time for kids to get lots of exercise, take a breather from academics, and beef up imaginative play.

That’s why summer reading is so great!

Books offer lots of springboard material to spark kids' imaginations. Besides, going on mental adventures is a great way to pass the time during those lulls that happen on summer days or for winding down at the end of the bedtime ritual before lights out.

The best part is children who read fun stories and play some of the Brain Stages games won't have to struggle to relearn stuff they've forgotten over the break. In fact, their skills will be even sharper for the coming year.

The old saying "practice makes perfect" may be an overstatement, but most of us have found that we get better at things when we do them often. The scientific reason is repetition refines neural pathways in the brain and makes them more efficient. Conversely, neglecting those connections makes them rusty, and kids can get frustrated trying to get back into the swing of learning when school starts again.

Visit the local library, book store, or both to find loads of fun for your kids (and you).
If your child is happy reading independently, awesome, but don't discount the together time in sharing stories, taking turns to read aloud. My kids and I used to check out both kinds of books on every trip to the library — one to read by ourselves and one to share.

My younger daughter and I read together through her high school years. We loved  discussing the characters, talking about the stories, and predicting what might happen next.

I miss those days. A lot. Take the opportunity to read with your kids while you can. 

The trick is to get books your kids will LOVE, that will take them on adventures, make them laugh and fantasize about other places, sticky situations, and learn about problem solving.











Fiction is about problem solving, and kids — well, all of us — can pick up a lot of ideas for real life reading imaginary stories. Authors go to great lengths to research settings, history, and customs to make their stories authentic (I know. I write young adult fiction).

Kids can learn as much from a novel, or more, than from a history or science book because they get exposed to concepts within the context of a story.

For the next several weeks, I'm going to post lists of tried-and-true titles that have a great reputation for enthralling scads of kids.

Some of these books have been around for a while. Some are fairly new. All are awesome reads.

Each list will be geared for a certain reading level.

Today's post is for second grade, give or take. And I listed series because good books are like cookies or chips — if your kids like one by a certain author, they'll probably want more.

If your children aren't up to this level yet, these will be wonderful read-aloud books to share. And if they usually read harder books, these titles can be quick and easy entertainment. After all, summer is a time to read for pleasure.

I’ve included a list for girls and a list for boys since the genders often show different interests at this age. But feel free to expose both lists to your son or daughter. The best books are the ones they choose for themselves, and all of these books are fun.

Please share these lists with your friends! Let's get lots of kids reading!

      Eight Favorite Series of Second Grade Girls (and Boys Too)



Ivy and Bean series by Annie Barrows—two unlikely girls become friends and engage in hilarious antics together.



Mercy Watson to the Rescue series by Kate DiCamillo—the Watsons’ pet pig gets into all kinds of ridiculous trouble trying to save the day.



Super Smart Science Series for kids by April Chloe Terrazas—complicated science concepts explained in an intriguing, understandable way for the younger set.



Gooney Bird Greene series by Lois Lowry—second-grade girl tells “true stories” to her classmates that are quite outlandish and fun.



Toys Go Out: Being the Adventures of a Knowledgeable Stingray, a Toughy Little Buffalo, and Someone Called Plastic by Emily Jenkins (trilogy)—little girls’ toys and their zany adventures together.



Junie B. Jones series by Barbara Park—hilarious, charming character kids love.


Judy Moody series by Megan McDonald—feisty, socially awkward third-grader who usually learns lessons the hard way; great early chapter books with fun illustrations.


Amelia Bedelia chapter book series by Herman Perish (nephew of Peggy Perish, author of the picture book series)—entertaining stories that misinterpret idioms and homophones.


       
        Eight Favorite Series of Second Grade Boys (and Girls Too)



Touchdown for Tommy by Matt Christopher—author of many books about sporty kids.



Stink series by Megan McDonald—Judy Moody’s younger brother, a second-grade boy, gets into all kinds of fun predicaments with the best of intentions.



Stink-O-Pedia: Super Stink-y Stuff from A to ZZZZ  also by Megan McDonald—a book of gross facts little boys love.



Super Smart Science series for kids by April Chloe Terrazas—complicated science concepts explained in a way kids can understand and feel smart.



Nate the Great mystery series by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat—for kids who need practice to get to grade-level reading and like a good whodunit.



Dog Man series by Dave Pilkey—his latest silly series that has kids clamoring for more.



Magic Tree House series by Mary Pope Osborne—for various reading levels; brings history to life and promotes conversations about historical events.



Magic School Bus series—mostly by Joanna Cole, also various reading levels; entertaining read-along books about science concepts learned through adventure.



Remember to share this post with your friends. Let's get kids reading this summer!

Not only is low-stress reading during the summer a relaxing, healthy pastime that keeps skills sharp, but fun books can make a big difference in helping your child handle social situations.
 
Usually, somewhere in third through fifth grade, children begin to recognize the need to navigate relationships. They wade through social dynamics with friends as well as other kids or adults they don’t get along with so well.

Both fiction and nonfiction stories present conflicts that eventually get solved. Kids can learn a lot about the ins and outs of how to deal with other people from characters in books. In other words:

Watching how a problem gets worked out in a story is a safe way to process what to do in real-life circumstances.
 
If you read together sometimes, talk to your child about characters’ interactions and ask how they might handle a similar situation. Discussing harmless hypotheticals now could be a huge help in a future emotional scuffle.
 

Check out the list of 14 well-loved books below.
 
Although the list is geared for fourth grade, younger children, or kids not quite ready  to read at this level yet, will enjoy these as read-aloud books. Older kids or more advanced readers will sail through these fun stories, perfect for summer. Most of these titles can be found at your public library. The links go to Amazon pages in case you would like to find out more.




The Time Warp Trio, swashbuckling series (16+ books) by Jon Scieszka—sends readers on a journey through events in history.



Magic School Bus series (167+ picture and chapter books) most by Joanne Cole—for kids who like science, cool illustrations, and quirky characters. Animated versions reinforce comprehension—available for purchase or library checkout.



Hank the Cowdog series by John R. Erickson (68+ books)—a dog that always gets into trouble but saves the day in the end, a beloved ongoing series since 1982.



Charlotte’s Web and Stuart Little by E.B. White—long-time, beloved grade four stories.



Matilda, James and the Giant Peach, George’s Marvelous Machine, The BFG, The Witches, and more by Roald Dahl—madcap clever books kids love.



Heroes of Olympus series (five books) by Rick Riordan—hugely popular with the action-loving set, leveled late third to early fifth grade for independent reading.



39 Clues series (eleven books) by various authors, including Rick Riordan—fantastic circumstances and nail-biting adventures kids can’t put down.



Magic Shop series (five books) by Bruce Coville—creepy, riveting stories (The Monster’s Ring; Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher; Jennifer Murdley’s Toad, and The Skull of Truth are on fourth-grade reading level; Juliet Dove, Queen of Love is leveled for fifth grade).



Adventures of Captain Underpants series (ten books) by Dav Pilkey—kooky stories with an unlikely hero who kids get a kick out of, and most of the series is written on fourth-grade reading level.



Little House on the Prairie series (nine books) by Laura Ingalls Wilder—historical fiction with lovable characters children have enjoyed for generations.



The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane by Kate DiCamillo—a toy rabbit gets lost and tossed into all kinds of crazy places and new adventures. DiCamillo has written several beloved stories at various reading levels.


The Spiderwick Chronicles (four books) by Tony DiTerlizzi—three siblings discover a field guide in the attic, left by their ancestor, that leads them to a dangerous parallel world.



Fudge series (five books) by Judy Bloom—nine-year-old Peter is frustrated by high-maintenance, hilarious little brother Fudge.



Wrinkle in Time series (five books, four leveled fourth grade) by Madeleine L’ Engle—one of the first science-fiction fantasy series for children (1962), still beloved today.

 
Note: For more lists of favorite titles categorized by reading level, check out these two websites: The Best Children’s Books and Kids Book Series.

Please share this post with friends and family. Let’s get kids reading this summer!
If you or your child have other favorite titles, please tell us about them in a comment below.

And we'd love for you to share reading experiences with your kids. How ’bout an idea for including relaxed reading in a busy family schedule?

Best wishes for a lovely summer!

      <title>“Brain Stages” Released August 28!</title>

Woo-hoo!

August 28, 2018, Brain Stages will be ready for readers to snap it up and find out lots of insider info and fun, effective ways to nurture kids' in line with how their brains develop.

You may have noticed Brain Stages has a new cover too. Double-whoo-hoo!

Sandra, independent publisher extraordinaire, revised the original cover with the feedback we received from friends and followers. Thanks so much to those of you who provided observations and suggestions!

Brain Stages is a grade-by-grade book, a What to Expect When You’re Expecting for elementary school. The idea is to help create a solid academic, social, emotional, and physical foundation to raise happy, well-adjusted children.

This project has been in the works for years. But our sources are as up-to-date as you can get. Many cited articles and studies came out this year. I so appreciate Sandra and her crew for allowing me to update things all the way to the deadline to get Brain Stages to the printer for the release of the advance review copies that will be out in mid-July.

New studies provide ever-greater detail to create an increasingly vivid picture for how children’s brains grow, develop, and learn.

In turn, I got to add valuable information, games, and activities up to the last second.

So. Much. Fun.

Not that scientists have brains all figured out. I’m sure lots of new discoveries are on the horizon, and I’ll keep you in-the-know on the Brain Stages blog.

(I’ve developed a sort of obsession with Google Alerts, to read articles and studies as soon as they’re published.)

And Reading Brain Stages will make you feel like you’re talking with a trusted friend, a supportive one with answers backed up by the latest intel and thousands of hours of experience.

Brain Stages has all kinds of features to save you (or someone you know) time, energy, and anguish to make the child-raising thing a whole lot of fun, such as:



Brain development and function and how to capitalize on meeting children wherever they are in their growth

Social and emotional tendencies at each grade (individuals' maturity may show up in more than one chapter as no two kids are alike)

Academic expectations in each grade

Ways to keep gifted kids engaged and develop their social skills

How to handle special needs for happier, more successful children

Games that boost mental and physical coordination to enhance creativity, math, language, and thinking abilities — best of all,  they make family life more enjoyable and bring relationships closer 


Activities to foster communication skills

Leveled book lists

Tips for quick, healthy nutrition

True stories that are sure to make you laugh, cry, or just give you relief to know you're not the only one . . .


I could go on and on. There's so much great stuff!

But don't worry, Brain Stages is broken into grade-level chapters, kindergarten through fifth, and will have an index to look up things that interest you.

Man, I would've LOVED to have had Brain Stages to support my child-raising journey in those early school years.

We’re living in exciting times!

Kids, parents, teachers, and caregivers have all been stressed out trying to keep up with societal expectations.

But less stress, more fun, and better results are right around the corner.

Here’s to happier, healthier kids, families, and schools everywhere!

Please forward this email to your friends, and share the good news on Facebook and Twitter. Let’s give people something positive to anticipate and celebrate!

Leave a comment if you have something you want to ask or tell us.
(Maybe tell us what you think of the new cover?)

Best wishes and happy summer!

Trish Wilkinson, co-author

      <title>Entice Kids to Read with Giggles and Intrigue, K – 2</title>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
				       Some kids love to pour over every printed word they can get their hands on. One of my daughters used to read cereal boxes and the backs of shampoo bottles. My nephew, however, would rather have gone to the dentist than pick up a book. His activity of choice was to play computer games, and my sister had to be diligent to keep his screen time moderate. What can you do if you have a child who doesn’t like to read? You know his neural pathways are busily forming and connecting. Reading practice is important. So how do you get him interested? The two things that have worked best to get kids reading in my experience are:
Make them laugh, and
Intrigue them



         For example, most four- to seven-year-olds love to giggle at funny friends like Arnold Lobel’s Frog and Toad or Cynthia Rylant’s Henry and Mudge. And these stories will give you the opportunity to talk about friendship and other values. For tough nuts to crack when it comes to reading, Barbara Park’s Junie B. Jones books are a riot. Kids often can’t wait to read the next one—and the next. Fair warning, Junie isn’t a perfect character—which is largely what draws children to her adventures. Junie uses the word “stupid” a lot, she tends to be naughty, and her grammar is silly and improper. Though kids find these things hilarious, some parents find them inappropriate. Personally, I appreciate how children distinguish between proper and improper behavior—how they tell me what Junie should have done instead of what she chose to do in the story. I also get a kick out of how they laugh when Junie says things like “thinked” instead of “thought.” But if you’re uncomfortable with such a character, choose other books and series from the list below. For instance, David Adler’s Cam Jansen enthralls kids with how she finds and interprets clues, and solves mysteries in her neighborhood. Before you know it, your child will begin to put together clues with Cam and try to figure out the puzzle before she does. You can begin reading the books on the list below aloud together. Then take turns reading paragraphs. As your child gets more confident and competent, you can switch off reading pages. After a while, he’ll probably take off on his own reading some of these books in the list below. 11 Series and Stories to Motivate Young Readers

Frog and Toad series by Arnold Lobel (4 books)—each has five simple, funny, sometimes instructive and touching stories about a frog and his friend, a toad.

Henry and Mudge series by Cynthia Rylant (29 books, last count)—stories of Henry, a young boy, and his experiences with his huge dog, Mudge.

You Read to Me, I’ll Read to You series by Mary Ann Hoberman (5 books)—collections of simple short fairy tales, fables, scary stories, and more.

Young Cam Jansen series by David Adler (20 books)—young-reader mysteries solved by a child detective who has a photographic memory.

Tacky the Penguin series by Helen Lester (7 books)—a funny, unique penguin learns to how to live in his community and celebrate his differences.

I wish I had Duck Feet by Theo. LeSeig (a.k.a. Dr. Seuss), and lots of other Dr. Seuss books. Kids love LeSieg/Seuss’s strange characters and silly rhymes.

Emily’s First 100 Days of School by Rosemary Wells—fun, adventure, math, what’s not to like in Emily’s, the resident bunny’s early school days?

The Boy Who Loved Words by Roni Schotter—a boy plays with words in silly, enjoyable ways that introduce vocabulary and word patterns.

Miss Smith’s Incredible Story Book series (4 books) by Michael Garland—teacher has a magic storybook where characters jump out and students go on adventures.

There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly by Ted Arnold—a funny story that builds on itself with a twist that first-graders love, in context that kids can decode.

Junie B. Jones series by Barbara Park, 17 madcap books of Junie’s adventures in kindergarten and 11 books about Junie in first grade
Psst. Third- and fourth-graders like these stories too, especially kids who need a little extra practice to improve their reading skills. Please pass along this post and share it on your social media so we can get as many kids reading as possible!Do you have other tried-and-true titles that have helped your child get into reading?Please share them in a comment.Happy reading!Trish Wilkinson

Before you know it, your child will begin to put together clues with Cam and try to figure out the puzzle before she does.<br> <br>You can begin reading the books on the list below aloud together. Then take turns reading paragraphs. As your child gets more confident and competent, you can switch off reading pages. After a while, he’ll probably take off on his own reading some of these books in the list below.<br> <br><strong>11</strong> <strong>Series and Stories to Motivate Young Readers</strong><ol>

      <title>“Red Light–Green Light”: Make Kids Better Writers</title>

				       Do you have or know a child who writes letters backwards sometimes? The most commonly flipped letters are b and d, but kids have been known to form letters every which way.When I was little, I often confused the b and d until I learned the trick Eli and I are about to show you in the less than 3-minute video. The Red Light, Green Light game, given to me by a resource specialist in San Diego, incorporates the trick my second-grade teacher gave me (more decades ago than I'd like to admit).Playing Red Light, Green Light has helped kids of all ages, even children who have learning disabilities, figure out which way the letters are supposed to go — not just the b and d but the whole alphabet. We take writing skills for granted, but several kinds of connections between neurons, synapses, and little organs in the brain are involved in processing language. It isn’t a wonder that kids get mixed up sometimes. Holding the pencil with an extra finger on top or some other impractical position can make writing harder (click here to see how to fix pencil grip). Add starting letters in wonky places, or writing letters from the bottom-up instead of the top-down, and writing can become an unpleasant chore.Luckily, with a bit of fun and practice, neural pathways can access revised information stored in brain’s memory centers. The Red Light, Green Light game retrains kids how to write letters from top to bottom and practices movement from left to right, which can improve both reading and writing. Watch Eli play the game with me in the short video. Initially, when we played the game a few weeks ago, he wrote both b and d from bottom to top. Now that he knows how to form the letters from top to bottom, he told me (and Michelle, his mom, confirmed) that writing has gotten much easier for him. And his reading has improved too!
   					 						 						 						 							document.getElementById("video-iframe-884805677828382045").style.opacity = 0; 							document.getElementById("wsite-video-container-884805677828382045").style.background = "none"; 							var videoIframe884805677828382045Content = '' 								+ '' 								+ '\x3C/script&gt;' 								+ '\x3C/script&gt;' 								+ ''+'ad&gt;' 								+ '' 								+ ''+'dy&gt;'+'ml&gt;'; 							setTimeout(function() { 								var videoIframe884805677828382045Actual =  document.getElementById("video-iframe-884805677828382045").contentDocument; 								videoIframe884805677828382045Actual.open().write(videoIframe884805677828382045Content); 								videoIframe884805677828382045Actual.close(); 							}, 500); 						 						 							#wsite-video-container-884805677828382045{ 								background: url(//www.weebly.com/uploads/red_light_green_light_game_700.jpg); 							}  							#video-iframe-884805677828382045{ 								background: url(//cdn2.editmysite.com/images/util/videojs/play-icon.png?1534365523); 							}  							#wsite-video-container-884805677828382045, #video-iframe-884805677828382045{ 								background-repeat: no-repeat; 								background-position:center; 							}  							@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), 								only screen and (        min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), 								only screen and (                min-resolution: 192dpi), 								only screen and (                min-resolution: 2dppx) { 									#video-iframe-884805677828382045{ 										background: url(//cdn2.editmysite.com/images/util/videojs/@2x/play-icon.png?1534365523); 										background-repeat: no-repeat; 										background-position:center; 										background-size: 70px 70px; 									} 							} 						 					 				  
Here's how to play Red Light-Green Light:1. You’ll need a red crayon and a green crayon. Why crayons? Because kids can feel the wax, and the tactile sensation helps to solidify the concept. You’ll also need lined paper. Any kind will do, but in most grocery stores now, they sell tablets with a top line, a middle dotted line, or "belt line", and a bottom line. When learning, or relearning, how to form letters, that belt line is helpful.2. Remind your child that green means “GO” and red means “STOP.” Put a green dot where the letter begins and continue with green dots for the entire letter on the first several tries. Place a red dot to signify where the letter should stop. Watch to make sure your child begins and ends the letter in the right places.
   
Note: A lowercase b starts at the top line, goes down to the bottom line, up to the middle, and around to form the “belly.” After your child gets familiar with how to form the letter, give the direction “Down, up, and around,” and have your child say it with you.
    A lowercase d is formed like an a with a long stick. Like an a begins just below the middle line, goes up to the middle line, and around to form the “derrier” (French for backside — kids get a kick out of that). The d is formed like an a, except the pencil reaches all the way to the top line and back down to the bottom line. Say with your child, “Around, up, and down." 
   3. When your child feels comfortable with tracing the letters with lots of green dots, make more letters with fewer and fewer dots until no more are needed. Place only a green dot to mark where the letter begins and a red dot where the letter is to end.Hint: Get a crayon sharpener (pencil sharpeners work too). Making dots with dull crayons makes them bigger than optimal.If your child still reverses a letter using green and red “lights,” help create a tactile memory by writing the entire letter with a green crayon. Then gently guide the pencil in his hand to trace the letter 10 times as consistently as possible.And have fun!Be liberal with the car engine sounds when you start at the green light and the brake sounds when you stop at the red light.Play Red Light, Green Light for several days in a row and watch your child's writing transform!The beauty of educational games is they often have wonderful side effects. Red Light, Green Light helps in grasping direction of movement. Truly understanding left to right is a huge help in learning to read.

      <title>Help Your Child Become a Math Whiz—And Become One Too!</title>

If you think people are either born good at numbers—or they aren’t—you might be excited to know that a little practice with a few simple games can get anyone calculating quickly in their heads.

My older sisters and younger brother always loved math, but I never liked numbers much growing up. My siblings, even my cousins, are all accountants and engineers. The rest of my family seemed to like numbers for numbers’ sake.

Me? I always liked the creative stuff—teaching, storytelling, singing, writing novels and articles, and now Brain Stages with Jackie to help people raise smart, happy kids.

With math, I went through the motions—I did what I was told to solve problems, usually got the right answer, but didn’t understand how I got there.

And forget figuring the cost of something at the grocery store in my head, or any other real-life reason for using math. Without paper and pencil or a calculator, I was lost.

Then I started teaching kids — and I wanted them to understand math better than I did. A fellow teacher showed me the Names for 10 game, and I learned the same number patterns repeated over and over.

I learned to apply patterns to larger numbers as well as decimals—in my head!

Before I knew it, with friends, I’d pop out how much a collection of things we’d need for a party would cost. I’d add sales tax (I lived in California then, where they have sales tax—go, Oregon, where we don’t!), and come up with the amount each person would need to contribute.

People used to widen their eyes at me and pull out their calculators. I have to admit that my smile got a little smug sometimes.

Did I somehow get smarter? Heck, no. Ha!

In playing the Names for 10 game with kids and showing them how to count coins like in the video below, where Eli counts coins and puts together different combinations to make the same amounts, I developed and reconfigured neural pathways in my brain.

And so can you!

Your kids can too!







Coin Video from Kirdy Molan on Vimeo.





Once these patterns become second nature, you won’t believe how many other math concepts and operations will become easier.

If you missed the two Names for 10 posts, you can find them here and here.

How do your kids earn money to toss in a piggy bank and count it later?

If you know another helpful math game, please share it with us!

Happy counting!

Trish W.

<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;">
If you think people are either born good at numbers—or they aren’t—you might be excited to know that a little practice with a few simple games can get anyone calculating quickly in their heads.<br>
<br>
My older sisters and younger brother always loved math, but I never liked numbers much growing up. My siblings, even my cousins, are all accountants and engineers. The rest of my family seemed to like numbers for numbers’ sake.<br>
<br>
Me? I always liked the creative stuff—teaching, storytelling, singing, writing novels and articles, and now <em>Brain Stages</em> with Jackie to help people raise smart, happy kids.<br>
<br>
With math, I went through the motions—I did what I was told to solve problems, usually got the right answer, but didn’t understand how I got there.<br>
<br>
And forget figuring the cost of something at the grocery store in my head, or any other real-life reason for using math. Without paper and pencil or a calculator, I was lost.<br>
<br>
Then I started teaching kids — and I wanted them to understand math better than I did. A fellow teacher showed me the <a href="/blog/names-for-ten-the-game-that-boosts-kids-math-skills">Names for 10 game</a>, and I learned the same number patterns repeated over and over.<br>
<br>
<strong>I learned to apply patterns to larger numbers as well as decimals—in my head!</strong><br>
<br>
Before I knew it, with friends, I’d pop out how much a collection of things we’d need for a party would cost. I’d add sales tax (I lived in California then, where they have sales tax—go, Oregon, where we don’t!), and come up with the amount each person would need to contribute.<br>
<br>
People used to widen their eyes at me and pull out their calculators. I have to admit that my smile got a little smug sometimes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Did I somehow get smarter? Heck, no. Ha!</strong><br>
<br>
In playing the <a href="/blog/more-ways-to-play-the-names-for-10-game-to-help-kids-become-math-wizards-and-you-too">Names for 10 game</a> with kids and showing them how to count coins like in the video below, where Eli counts coins and puts together different combinations to make the same amounts, <strong>I developed and reconfigured neural pathways in my brain.</strong><br>
<br>
And so can you!<br>
<br>
Your kids can too!<br>
<br>

<div id="958802795733885836" align="left" style="width: 100%; overflow-y: hidden;" class="wcustomhtml">

</div>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<br>
Once these patterns become second nature, you won’t believe how many other math concepts and operations will become easier.<br>
<br>
If you missed the two Names for 10 posts, you can find them <a href="/blog/names-for-ten-the-game-that-boosts-kids-math-skills">here</a> and <a href="/blog/more-ways-to-play-the-names-for-10-game-to-help-kids-become-math-wizards-and-you-too">here</a>.<br>
<br>
<strong>How do your kids earn money to toss in a piggy bank and count it later?</strong><br>
<br>
If you know another helpful math game, please share it with us!<br>
<br>
Happy counting!<br>

What can you do to give your child a leg up in today’s competitive society while raising a happy, well-adjusted future adult?
How can you get a disinterested kid engaged in school and learning? (Hint: It's probably not what you think.)
How can you help an anxious child relax for better learning?
What sure-fire ways can you help a struggling child get caught up in math or reading — and have FUN while you're at it?
How can you get your gifted child's needs met?
What can you do to help kids develop social skills — even if dealing with people isn't your best thing?
What’s the most effective way to empower children for a successful life? (Hint: This is also probably not what you think.) And much more!

Raise Smart, Confident Kids and Have Fun Doing It


New brain research comes out almost daily, providing insight as to how kids develop and learn. Brain Stages, in accordance with science, answers questions that so many parents struggle with, such as:
What can you do to give your child a leg up in today’s competitive society while raising a happy, well-adjusted future adult?
How can you get your disinterested kid engaged in school and learning? (Hint: It's probably not what you think.)
How can you help an anxious child relax for better learning?
What sure-fire ways can you help a struggling child get caught up in math or reading—and have FUN together while you're doing it?
How can you get your gifted kid's needs met to stimulate interest in classroom activities?
How can you help your child develop social skills—even if dealing with people isn't your best thing?
What’s the most effective way to empower your child for a successful life? (Hint: This is also probably not what you think.)

Though we still have much to grasp about how kids learn, technology has shed considerable light on effective ways to stimulate children’s organic ability to absorb and apply experiences in harmony with how their brains develop.Jacqueline Frischknecht, PhD, and mother of three, and I, Trish Wilkinson, mother of two and veteran teacher, set out to share with you what we’ve learned through thousands of hours of experience and research.We hope you enjoy the games, activities, how-tos, and insider information to support school-age kids’ brain development to help ensure their well-being and academic success. Our goal is for your family to have fun together at every age, while you raise smart, happy kids. Even better, you’ll have access to everything we’ve learned in the past 35 years in a much more comprehensive, entertaining, organized fashion this spring 2018, when Sandra Jonas Publishing releases our book:Brain Stages: How to Raise Smart, Happy Kids and Have Fun Doing It, K–5                                        Sadly, Jackie passed away before we finished the book. It is my hope that she would be pleased with our Brain Stages website and publication. If you’d like to submit a video of your child doing an activity that you believe could help other parents and kids, or you have helpful information to share, please leave send an email to trish@thebrainstages.com.We'd also love for you to join our community of parents, grandparents, caregivers, educators, and other people who want to help make the world a better place by asking questions or writing helpful comments after blog posts.Thanks for visiting!Trish Wilkinson
